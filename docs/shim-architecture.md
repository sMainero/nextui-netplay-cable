# Shim architecture

Netplay currently ships patched `minarch.elf`, `gambatte_libretro.so` and
`gpsp_libretro.so` for one exact NextUI build, so every NextUI release needs six
new binaries and a merge against a drifting `minarch`. This is the replacement:
nothing is patched, and nothing tracks a NextUI build.

## Why the cores never needed rebuilding

The core "patches" are barely patches:

- **gambatte** — a Makefile stanza adding `tg5040`/`tg5050` with `HAVE_NETWORK=1`.
  Zero source changes. GB link is upstream libretro.
- **gpsp** — two small fixes to `rfu.c`/`libretro.c` (disconnect handling, packet
  queue 4→16). GBA RFU netplay is upstream.

Both link only against libc/libm/libstdc++/libgcc and export exactly the standard
libretro symbols. Nothing in either binds to a NextUI build — they are `dlopen`'d
over the stable libretro C ABI. They need rebuilding when the core sources or the
toolchain change, not when NextUI ships.

## The shim

`shim/shim.c` is a libretro core that wraps another libretro core. minarch loads
it; it `dlopen`s the real core (`RTLD_LOCAL`, so the two sets of `retro_*` symbols
do not collide) and forwards every entry point. Sitting in between gives us the
seams netplay needs:

| Seam | Replaces |
|---|---|
| `retro_set_environment` | answering `SET_NETPACKET_INTERFACE` ourselves — GB/GBA link on a stock frontend, no `ma_environment.c` patch (**done**) |
| `retro_set_input_state` | `Netplay_getPlayerButtons` in `ma_input.c` |
| `retro_run` | frame gating; returning without running the core is a legal frame skip that keeps the frontend responsive |
| `retro_serialize` / `retro_unserialize` | hide frontend save states while preserving protocol-owned initial sync and authoritative recovery |
| `retro_get_memory_data` / `retro_get_memory_size` | hide SRAM/RTC from the shared-screen guest frontend while retaining protocol access to the wrapped core's raw buffers |
| `retro_get_variable` | `minarch_get/setCoreOptionValue`, `forceCoreOptionUpdate`, `saveConfig` |
| `retro_unload_game` / `retro_load_game` | `minarch_reloadGame` |

Network I/O belongs on a shim-owned background thread, which also removes the
reason `minarch_hdmimon` / `beforeSleep` / `afterSleep` / `Netplay_pollWhilePaused`
existed — 26 call sites whose only job was keeping the link alive while minarch's
loop was busy.

With no session armed the shim is a pure passthrough.

### The filename constraint

minarch derives `core.name` from the core's **path**, not its reported
`library_name` (`ma_core.c`):

```c
void Core_getName(char* in_name, char* out_name) {
	strcpy(out_name, basename(in_name));
	char* tmp = strrchr(out_name, '_');   // truncate at last underscore
	tmp[0] = '\0';
}
```

and `core.name` feeds both:

```c
sprintf(core.config_dir, USERDATA_PATH        "/%s-%s", core.tag, core.name);
sprintf(core.states_dir, SHARED_USERDATA_PATH "/%s-%s", core.tag, core.name);
```

So the shim **must** be loaded under the real core's filename. Loaded as
`netplay_shim_libretro.so` it would yield `core.name = "netplay_shim"` and
silently relocate every save state. `launcher/minarch.elf` stages a copy at
`<pak>/cores/<realcore>_libretro.so` for exactly this reason, and
`launcher/test.sh` asserts it.

(`strrchr`'s result is used unchecked, so a core filename with no underscore
crashes minarch. `*_libretro.so` always has one.)

## Getting the shim loaded

Emu paks invoke `minarch.elf` **unqualified**, so it resolves through `PATH`
(`MinUI.pak/launch.sh`: `export PATH=$SYSTEM_PATH/bin:...`). That is the hook.

### Tier 1 — launch stubs (default)

`getEmuPath` (`utils.c`) checks the SD card before the system paks:

```c
sprintf(pak_path, "%s/Emus/%s/%s.pak/launch.sh", SDCARD_PATH, PLATFORM, emu_name);
if (exists(pak_path)) return;
sprintf(pak_path, "%s/Emus/%s.pak/launch.sh", PAKS_PATH, emu_name);
```

So for a pak living under `$SYSTEM_PATH`, we drop a stub at the free SD path. It
prepends our launcher dir to `PATH` and delegates to the original, which runs at
its real location and therefore derives `EMU_TAG` and `CORES_PATH` correctly. The
original is never modified. The stub is identical for every system — it takes its
tag from `$0` — so `install-stubs.sh` writes the same bytes to each.

Both link cores are in this tier:

| Class | Paks | Cores |
|---|---|---|
| SYSTEM (free SD path) | FC, SFC, MD, PS, **GBA, GB, GBC** | fceumm, snes9x, picodrive, pcsx_rearmed, **gpsp, gambatte** |
| EXTRAS (owns its SD path) | FBN, SUPA, 32X, SEGACD, GG, SMS, FDS, SG1000 | fbneo, supafaust, picodrive |

### Tier 2 — staged copy + bind mount (opt-in)

An EXTRAS pak already occupies the SD path, so there is nothing to override. We
do not modify paks we do not own. `wrap-pak.sh` instead stages a copy under our
own directory and bind-mounts it over the original:

```
$NP/wrapped/<TAG>.pak/
├── launch.sh       ours - puts the shim on PATH, then runs launch.sh.old
├── launch.sh.old   the original, verbatim
└── ...             everything else the original contained
```

```sh
mount --bind "$NP/wrapped/FBN.pak" "$SDCARD_PATH/Emus/$PLATFORM/FBN.pak"
```

The original bytes on disk are never touched, and `down` (or a reboot) restores
everything. Passthrough is just running `launch.sh.old`.

The copy has to include the pak's other files, because the mount replaces the
whole directory and the original derives its paths from `$0` — which, under the
mount, resolves back into our staged copy. Only two netplay-capable paks bundle
a core (`CORES_PATH=$(dirname "$0")`):

| Stages as | Paks |
|---|---|
| `launch.sh` only, a few KB | 32X, SEGACD, GG, SMS, SG1000, FDS |
| plus the bundled core | FBN, SUPA |

Because the mount replaces the directory, `EMU_TAG` and `CORES_PATH` still
resolve correctly — `launcher/test.sh` asserts both by presenting the staged
directory at the original path.

Two things not to do instead:

- **Shadowing only the pak's `launch.sh`** hides the original the stub needs to
  delegate to. Stashing the original at a second path does not save it: it then
  runs with a different `$0`, so `CORES_PATH=$(dirname "$0")` points somewhere
  without the core — breaking exactly FBN and SUPA.
- **Shadowing `minarch.elf`** covers every pak with one mount, but if anything
  is wrong *every* game launch breaks rather than one system. The staged-copy
  approach keeps the blast radius per pak.

The staged copy goes stale if the pak is updated underneath it, so `sync`
fingerprints the source and `up` refuses to mount a stale copy. Mounts do not
survive a reboot; run `sync` then `up` from a `boot.d` hook to persist.

## What does not survive

- **The in-game netplay menu.** `api.c` is compiled into `minarch.elf`, which is
  built without `-rdynamic` — 0 of its 347 dynamic symbols are `GFX_`/`PAD_`, so
  nothing outside the executable can call in. Session setup moves to the pak app,
  which already compiles its own `api.c`. In-game the shim can only draw into the
  core's framebuffer.
- **Frontend save states.** During an armed session the shim reports no state
  capability, so save/load, autosave and auto-resume fail closed. Stock minarch
  hardcodes its five menu rows and does not inspect that capability when drawing
  them, so hiding the rows themselves requires a patched minarch binary.
  Protocol-owned synchronization bypasses the exported wrappers and calls the
  real core directly.

Persistent game saves are separate from frontend save states. In shared-screen
mode, the host frontend loads and writes SRAM/RTC normally. Authoritative
transfers carry the host's raw save-memory and RTC buffers alongside serialized
core state; the guest uses those buffers in memory, while the shim reports zero
persistent-memory size to the guest frontend so it neither loads nor writes a
local save. Disk filenames and rzip compression remain entirely minarch policy.
The guest core's `GET_SAVE_DIRECTORY` is also redirected to a fresh process-local
directory under `/tmp`, covering auxiliary files a core manages directly rather
than exposing as libretro save memory.
PCSX-ReARMed is forced to `memcard1=libretro` and `memcard2=none` for the session
so its directly managed second card cannot bypass that policy. Single-player
core settings are not changed.

Unbinding the shortcuts via config is not a fix: `Config_readControls` reads
`default_cfg` then `user_cfg`, so the user's bindings win. And forcing a config
sandbox via `DEVICE` or a different reported core name would relocate
`states_dir` — same save-state loss as above.

## Status

Passthrough is verified on a TrimUI Brick (tg5040), NextUI, gpSP/GBA. The stub
installer covered the seven netplay-capable system paks (FC, GB, GBA, GBC, MD,
PS, SFC) and removed all seven again on disarm.

The load went through the shim:

```
[netplay-shim] wrapping /mnt/SDCARD/.system/tg5040/cores/gpsp_libretro.so (session=none)
[INFO] core: gpsp version: gpSP (v1.1.0-69e86eb) tag: GBA
       (valid_extensions: gba|bin|agb|gbz|u1 need_fullpath: 1)
```

`core: gpsp`, not `netplay_shim` — so the filename staging held and the derived
paths were the stock ones:

```
/mnt/SDCARD/.userdata/tg5040/GBA-gpsp/minarch-brick.cfg
/mnt/SDCARD/Saves/GBA/Advance Wars 2 - Black Hole Rising (USA).srm
```

`library_name`, `valid_extensions` and `need_fullpath` all arrived verbatim. The
only warnings in the log (`LEDS_applyRules called before PWR_init`) appear the
same number of times in logs predating the shim, so they are existing NextUI
startup noise. Outside shared-screen guest mode, SRAM is still written normally
on exit.

Link play is verified host-side only: `shim/test/link.sh` runs two shim
instances over loopback with a core that uses the netpacket interface, and
asserts the interface is accepted, both sides start with the right client ids,
packets cross in both directions, and teardown reaches the core.

Not yet exercised on device: link play between two units, and the tier 2 bind
mount. Shared-screen input lockstep, authoritative desync recovery, and both
process-rejoin paths are covered by the host-side integration suite; the rejoin
paths still need two-device fault testing.

## Link play

The core asks for a netpacket interface during `retro_set_environment`. A stock
minarch returns false and the core disables link entirely; the shim answers it
instead and provides the transport, so nothing about the frontend has to change.

`netlink.c` is that transport: two players, direct TCP, host listens and client
connects. Receiving runs on its own thread, which is what lets a link survive
the frontend blocking on a menu, a sleep or a long save — the reason the patched
minarch needed hooks in `Menu_loop` and the sleep path.

Per frame, before the core runs, `retro_run` settles the session state and
delivers queued packets. libretro assigns the host `client_id` 0, so with two
players the remote is simply the other id. On teardown the core is told
`disconnected` before `stop`, in that order, because gpSP needs the disconnect
to unstick its RFU state machine.

The shim only claims netpacket support when a session is armed. Disarmed, the
request forwards to the frontend, which refuses — so the core ends up in exactly
the state it would be in without the shim.

A session is a file:

```
role=host|client
port=55437
peer=192.168.1.42    # clients only
session_id=<generated hex> # namespaces host recovery data in /tmp
```

`launcher/minarch.elf` finds it at `<pak>/state/session` and exports
`NETPLAY_SESSION`. It has to discover the file rather than read an environment
variable, because games launched from the game list are started by NextUI and
there is no point in that path where anyone could set one.

## Building

The shim needs no NextUI checkout - only a cross-compiler and the vendored
`libretro.h`. Mount the **pak root**, not `shim/`, because the makefile writes up
to `../bin/`. `-u` keeps the container from leaving root-owned artifacts in the
worktree:

```sh
cd Netplay.pak
docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD":/w -w /w/shim \
	ghcr.io/loveretro/tg5040-toolchain:latest make PLATFORM=tg5040
docker run --rm -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD":/w -w /w/shim \
	ghcr.io/loveretro/tg5050-toolchain:latest make PLATFORM=tg5050
```

`make native` builds for the host instead, which is all the test suites need.

The result is about 20 KB per platform, linked against nothing but `libdl` and
`libc`, exporting the 25 standard libretro entry points. For comparison, the
binary-patching approach shipped a 705 KB `minarch.elf`, a 3.1 MB gambatte and a
917 KB gpsp *per NextUI build*, in both patched and original copies.

## Layout

```

Both test scripts are host-only and need no device.
