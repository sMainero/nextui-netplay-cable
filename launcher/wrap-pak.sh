# Covers emulator paks that already own their SD path, without writing to them.

#   wrap-pak.sh sync     stage a copy of each wrappable pak under our own dir
#   wrap-pak.sh up       bind-mount the staged copies over the originals
#   wrap-pak.sh down     unmount
#   wrap-pak.sh status
#
# install-stubs.sh handles paks under $SYSTEM_PATH by dropping an override at
# the free SD path. An EXTRAS pak occupies that path itself, so there is nothing
# to override. Rather than modify a pak we do not own, we stage a copy:
#
#   $NP/wrapped/<TAG>.pak/
#   |-- launch.sh       ours - puts the shim on PATH, then runs launch.sh.old
#   |-- launch.sh.old   the original, verbatim
#   `-- ...             everything else the original contained
#
# and bind-mount that directory over the original. The original bytes on disk
# are never touched, and `down` (or a reboot) restores everything.
#
# Why the copy has to include the pak's other files: the mount replaces the
# whole directory, and paks like FBN and SUPA bundle their core and locate it
# with CORES_PATH=$(dirname "$0"). Under the mount that resolves into our staged
# directory, so the core has to be there. Paks that use the system cores dir
# stage as just a couple of shell scripts.
#
# Scoped per pak on purpose. If something is wrong, one system is affected
# rather than every game launch.
