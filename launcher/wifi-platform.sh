# Everything this pak knows about how a given platform runs its WiFi client
# stack, in one place.
#
# Why a table rather than probing: the pak shipped a single implementation built
# from the two devices it was developed on (Brick, A30), and every assumption in
# it - `iw` for association, `udhcpc` for DHCP, `/etc/wifi/wifi_init.sh` for
# bring-up - is false on at least one of the platforms it claims to support.
# None of those failed loudly. `iw dev wlan0 link` on a device with no `iw`
# prints nothing and exits non-zero, which is indistinguishable from "not
# associated", so the H700 sat in a 5x11s join loop that could never succeed and
# then "restored" WiFi into a state with no DHCP client running at all. Probing
# harder would not have helped: the answers are knowable, and where they are
# knowable they should be written down.
#
# Sourced for its functions, or run directly as a dispatcher so the C app can
# reach the same implementations:
#
#   . wifi-platform.sh          -> np_* functions
#   sh wifi-platform.sh assoc [SSID]
#
# Expects PLATFORM and (for the SD-card wifi_init.sh platforms) SYSTEM_PATH.
#
# Verified sources for the table below:
#   tg5040/tg5050  NextUI skeleton/SYSTEM/tg5040/etc/wifi/wifi_init.sh
#   my282          NextUI skeleton/SYSTEM/my282/etc/wifi/wifi_init.sh

#                  + docs/h700-port/{00-device-facts,07-wifi-bluetooth}.md
#
# Anything not verified is left as "auto" rather than guessed. An auto entry
# degrades to the old probe-and-hope behaviour, which is the correct default for
# a platform nobody has measured - but it is visible here as a gap rather than
# hidden as an assumption.
