# Covers the built-in emulator paks by bind mount, writing nothing to the SD
# card's Emus tree.
#
#   bind-mount.sh sync     stage a copy of each covered pak under our own dir
#   bind-mount.sh up       mount the staged copies over the originals
#   bind-mount.sh down     unmount and clean up
#   bind-mount.sh boot     what auto.sh calls - restore mounts after a reboot
#   bind-mount.sh status
#   bind-mount.sh hook-install / hook-remove
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACES
#
# install-stubs.sh created $SDCARD_PATH/Emus/<PLATFORM>/<TAG>.pak/launch.sh for
# every covered system - seven new directories in a tree the user did not ask us
# to touch, which persist until something removes them and which look exactly
# like paks the user installed. This leaves that tree completely alone.
#
# WHERE THE MOUNT GOES, AND WHY THERE
#
# Over $SYSTEM_PATH/paks/Emus/<TAG>.pak - the original's own directory.
#
# Not over the SD path: it does not exist, and creating it is the thing we are
# removing.
#
# Not over the original launch.sh as a file, though file bind mounts do work on
# these kernels. Shadowing launch.sh hides the original *at its own path*, so
# our replacement has no way to reach it, and reaching a stashed copy instead
# breaks $0 - which is where EMU_TAG comes from:
#
#     EMU_TAG=$(basename "$(dirname "$0")" .pak)
#
# Mounting the directory keeps $0 at the pak's real path, so EMU_TAG, and
# anything else derived from it, stays correct with no tricks.
#
#   $NP/mounts/<TAG>.pak/
#   |-- launch.sh       ours - preamble, then runs launch.sh.old
#   |-- launch.sh.old   the original, verbatim
#   `-- ...             everything else the original contained
#
# The original bytes on disk are never modified. `down`, or a reboot, restores
# everything exactly - which is also why this has to run at boot.
#
# Scoped per pak on purpose: if something is wrong, one system is affected
# rather than every game launch.
