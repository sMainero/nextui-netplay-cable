# Get back onto the normal network if the ad hoc one goes away underneath us.
#
# The gap this closes: you join a host's network, the host powers off or ends
# its session, and nothing is running that would notice. The other three
# recovery points all need something to happen first - opening the app, starting
# a game, or pressing Restore WiFi - so sitting in the system menu you are
# stranded until you go looking.
#
# Scope is deliberately narrow:
#
#   * Started when a join succeeds, not at boot. A device that never uses ad hoc
#     never runs this, so it costs nothing to have.
#   * Exits as soon as the shared wifi_restore record is gone. It is written when we
#     take the client stack down and removed when we put it back, so the
#     watchdog's lifetime is exactly the window where stranding is possible.
#   * Exits if we are already back on a normal network, cleaning up the record.
#   * Never acts on one failed check. A host in a menu, or a moment of RF noise,
#     must not kick anyone off a working session.
#
# A reboot does not need covering: the temporary supplicant config lives in
# /tmp, so the platform's own init brings WiFi back normally on the next boot.

# Pak path as $1 when the caller knows it (the launch stub derives it from the
# session file); otherwise fall back to the environment. Relying on inherited
# SDCARD_PATH/PLATFORM alone was fragile - the stub does not export them.
