/*
 * netplay shim - a libretro core that wraps another libretro core.
 *
 * minarch loads this instead of the real core; we dlopen the real one and
 * forward every entry point to it. Sitting between the frontend and the core
 * gives us the seams netplay needs without patching minarch:
 *
 *   - retro_set_environment  we answer SET_NETPACKET_INTERFACE ourselves, so
 *                            GB/GBA link works on a stock frontend
 *   - retro_set_input_state  port 1 can be served from the network
 *   - retro_run              frame advance can be gated on the peer
 *   - retro_(un)serialize    hide frontend save states during sessions while
 *                            retaining protocol-owned state synchronization
 *
 * With no session armed this is a pure passthrough and the game behaves
 * exactly as it would without us.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this .so must be installed under the real core's filename.
 * minarch derives core.name from basename(core_path) truncated at the last
 * underscore (ma_core.c Core_getName), and core.name feeds both config_dir
 * and states_dir. Loading us as "netplay_shim_libretro.so" would relocate the
 * user's save states. The launcher copies us to <realcore>_libretro.so.

// "Auto", which on my282 means the conservative governor with up_threshold=80
// over a 10ms window - and a frame-paced emulator never looks busy to that. It
// computes for two or three milliseconds and then waits for the next frame, so
// measured load sits near 12-20% and the governor stays at its floor
// indefinitely. Under four full-load spinners the same device ramps to 1344MHz
// in about two seconds, so the headroom is real; nothing in a well-behaved
// emulator ever asks for it.
//
// So the frequency is pinned here rather than left to a heuristic that is
// measuring the wrong thing. Doing it through the frontend's own core option
// would not work: minarch applies minarch_cpu_speed after the core is loaded,

// that has happened, and re-asserts periodically in case a menu round trip

/*
 * What to answer mGBA when it asks the frontend for a target audio rate.
 *
 * Default is 0: decline, and let mGBA keep its own 65536. That is measured, not
 * assumed - see below - and this knob exists so the measurement can be redone.
 *
 * The idea was that mGBA upsamples GBA's native 32768Hz to 65536 for nothing,
 * since minarch resamples again to 48000 for the device. Answering 32768 makes
 * libretro.c take its `coreSampleRate == targetSampleRate` branch and skip its
 * resampler entirely.
 *
 * Measured on an A30 at 1344MHz, Mario Kart Super Circuit, process-wide:
 *
 *   target 65536 (declining, mGBA's default)   12.63 ms/frame
 *   target 32768                               14.64 ms/frame
 *
 * Backwards, and the reason is instructive. 32768 is the GBA's *reset* value;
 * games write SOUNDBIAS and most then run at 65536 or higher. So mGBA's default
 * already matches what a real game produces and its resampler is already being
 * skipped - answering 32768 does not remove a conversion, it *adds* one, and the
 * ~2ms delta is mGBA's resampler being switched on rather than off. minarch has
 * no same-rate short-circuit either (api.c resample_audio runs unconditionally),
 * so there was never a second pass to collapse.
 *
 * The +49% reported for `audio_out_rate = 32768` elsewhere is a RetroArch
 * number, and RetroArch's audio path is not this one.
 *
 * A game that genuinely runs at 32768 would want that answered instead, and
 * would save the ~2ms. We cannot know which at load time - the environment call
 * lands before the game writes SOUNDBIAS - and mGBA fixes the rate once. Hence
 * the knob rather than a guess.
